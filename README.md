Give a look into:
* content - what is the content of each column
* types - each column has its own data type, it may be int, float or object
* classes - if You want to do a ML project with predictions included You have to pick which column is Your class that You will try to predict
* usefullness - think about which column is usefull and which is not, if some columns are potencially usefull make sure they have proper data type
